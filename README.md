# Cristel - Logiciel serveur videotex pour Apple ][

This is the 6502 assembly code I wrote in the mid 80s on my Apple //e to extend the Applesoft BASIC with 20+ new commands to access the Apple Tell card.

Cristel allowed to write videotex servers using the Apple II BASIC using commands like:

- &WAIT  : to wait for an incoming call
- &PRINT : to send some text on the (remote) Minitel screen
- &INPUT : to wait for a user input
etc...

## Retrieval...

I retrieved this source code from my 35+ years old floppies using an Apple //c bought on ebay and the Floppy Emu SD (emulates a floppy drive and stores data on microSD card).
Then I used AppleCommander on my Mac to extract the content on the source files.

## Assembler...

I was using BIGMAC assembler from Glen Bredon, which then became "Merlin" see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin_(assembler)
